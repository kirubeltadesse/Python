You should use a Jupyter Notebook, please use print() and not the default output from Jupyter, for your answers to the programming questions.  For the other answers, you can just complete them in this Word Document.  The questions all refer to Python.

1. List the arithmetic operators and their meaning.
+ Addition (+) Adds values on either side of the operator. a + b = 30
- Subtraction (-) Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.  a – b = -10
* Multiplication (\*)  Multiplies values on either side of the operator  a * b = 200

* Division(/)  Divides left hand operand by right hand operand b / a = 2
* Modulus(%) Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder b % a = 0
* Exponent(\*\*)1 Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators a**b =10 to the power 20
*  Floor Division (//) - The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed. But if one of the operands is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity):  9//2 = 4 and 9.0//2.0 = 4.0, -11//3 = -4, -11.0//3 = -4.0. 

Example: +  addition
2. Identify the use of the following in terms of data structures:
```
[ ] = List
{ } = List usually used with a key and a value for exampel {'key':value}
( ) = tuple
```
3. Create a program that uses a function to determine the larger of two numbers and return the larger to the main body of the program and then print it.  You have to enter the numbers from the keyboard so you have to use input.
```
Answer => examq->q3.py
```
4. Create a program that generates 10 random numbers between 0 and 100.  Use methods from numpy or any other library to produce the mean and standard deviation for the numbers.  Store the numbers in a list.
```
Answer => examq->q4.py
```
5. Differentiate between a list and a dataframe.

```
Dataframe is a 2 dimenational labeled data structure. A data frame is used for storing data tables. It is a list of vectors of equal length. List can contain elements of different types.
```
 

6. Write a program that is able to read in the data from the following file and display the count for each of the values.  Also, display the number of the elements in the file.  Use a dataframe to contain the data you read in from the file.

I will attach the file so you can down load it from Blackbook.

```
Answer => examq->q6.py
```


7. Write a program that uses the same file.  Have that program produce the largest and smallest value from the file.  You can just modify the program in No. 6 above to solve this problem.

```
Answer => examq->q6.py
```



8. Who is the creator of Python and what year was it first available – your answer on the year can be relative if you can’t find an exact answer.

```
Python was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991
```

9. Which of the following data types are mutable?
```
[X] tuple [ ] dictionary [ ] dataframe [ ] integer [ ] list
```
10. Write a program that uses the data from the numbers.csv file and sorts them in descending order.  You can print the modified list if you want.  The highest number is 10 and the lowest is 1.

```
Answer => examq->q10.py
```


11. Using the data from the numbers file, remove all of the duplicate numbers and print the list of only unique numbers.

```
Answer => examq->q11.py
```


12. Write a function that will determine if a state is True or False.   The statement is “If a > b and b is not negative.”  You should return a boolean value to the main program and then have statement printed that says the statement is True or the statement is False.  Put the call to the function and the input statement in a while loop that will continue until you enter 99 for a.  The program will then display – Goodbye and Goodnight!!

```
Answer => examq->q12.py
```


13. Write a short program that displays how one can iterate over a list containing 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0.
The program will output each of the individual values, one be line.

```
Answer => examq->q13.py
```


14. What are the purposes / contents of the libraries: numPy, sciPy, dataframes in general.

```
numPy is an extension to the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.
SciPy builds on the NumPy array object and is part of the NumPystack which includes tools like Matplotlib, pandas and SymPy. 
dataframes are 2D data structure use in analysing and visualizing data with in the pandas liberary.


```

15. T / F Python is a general purpose programming language.

```
Answer => True
```
